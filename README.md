# ConnectFour

This is a simple proyect used for learning how to use matrices in java.
Besides, it was great to learn java basics.

## How to play

Each player places a token in his turn. The first to connect four in a row wins the game.
Its a tie when the board is full and no one has reached the goal.

You can run locally using the following commands:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/moradelboca/connectfour

  cd connectfour/target

  java -jar ConnectFour-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Java RE 17 needs to be installed in the computer first.

## Bot

There's a "attempt" of bot coded. In order to use it, you will need a OpenAI API Key.
